Neko is a Python package for extracting, visualizing, converting, and studying interactions from databases into executable activity flow-based models. It's built on top of `Omnipath <https://github.com/saezlab/omnipath>`_, `Pypath <https://github.com/saezlab/pypath>`_, and `Atopo <https://github.com/druglogics/atopo>`_.

**Note**: Neko is currently in development and approaching its final stages. It is available on pip under the name "nekomata".

Features
--------

- Network creation and manipulation
- Connection of nodes and subnetworks
- Gene-to-phenotype mapping
- Network visualization and export helpers
- Interaction database integration
- Branching network history with automatic snapshots, HTML/SVG rendering, and pruning controls

Installation
------------

`NeKo` is still in its alpha version. You can install it from PyPI and also install the necessary external dependencies.

1. **Install `NeKo` from PyPI**:

   First, install the main package from PyPI (nekomata, do not confuse with pip install neko or pip install pyneko, those are other packages):

   .. code-block:: bash

       pip install nekomata

2. **Install External Dependencies**:

   `NeKo` requires some external dependencies that are not available on PyPI. To install these dependencies, run:

   .. code-block:: bash

       pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sysbio-curie/Neko/main/requirements.txt

This two-step process will install both the core `NeKo` package and its external dependencies.

Installation from Source
------------------------

For the latest development version, you can still clone the repository and install directly from the source:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/sysbio-curie/Neko.git
    cd Neko
    pip install .
    pip install -r requirements.txt

This will give you the latest version of `NeKo` (not officially released, so be aware there could be some bugs) along with the necessary external dependencies.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If during the installation you encounter problems with the installation of Graphviz, you could be missing basic Graphiz installation on your machine.
You can install it on Linux system with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev

or on Mac system:

.. code-block:: bash

    brew install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev

Jupyter Notebooks
-----------------

We provide a comprehensive set of Jupyter notebooks that offer a detailed and user-friendly explanation of the package. These notebooks cover all modules of NeKo and provide a complete overview of how to use the package:


1) Usage
2) Build network using user-defined resources
3) Stepwise connection: a focus on the INE algorithm
4) Connect to upstream components
5) Build network based on kinase-phosphosite interactions
6) Connect to downstream Gene Ontology terms
7) Map tissue expression
8) Network comparison
9) Re-creating famous pathways from SIGNOR and WIKIPATHWAYS using NeKo
10) Import and complete a network
11) Network history, branching, and visualisation


You can find these notebooks in the `notebooks` directory of the repository.

version 1.1.0
--------------

- Network creation and manipulation: The package allows for the creation of a network of nodes and edges, with various methods for enrichment analysis. This includes adding and removing nodes and edges, loading a network from a SIF (Simple Interaction Format) file, and adding paths to the edge list of the network.
- Database integration: The package provides methods to integrate interactions from databases such as Omnipath, Signor, HURI and others. The user can also integrate personal resources to mine for interactions.
- Database translation: The package provides methods to convert the identifiers of a database storing edge lists into Uniprot.
- Connection of nodes: The package provides several methods to connect nodes in the network. This includes connecting all nodes, connecting a subgroup of nodes, connecting all nodes of a network object, and connecting subcomponents of a network object.
- Branching network history: automatic state capture for each enrichment step, undo/redo with branching, HTML/SVG history visualisation, and configurable pruning via ``set_max_history``.
