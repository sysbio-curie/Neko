	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Due to the complexity and heterogeneity of multicellular biological systems, mathematical models that take into account cell signalling, cell population behaviour and the extracellular environment are particularly helpful. We present PhysiBoSS, an open source software which combines intracellular signalling using Boolean modelling (MaBoSS) and multicellular behaviour using agent-based modelling (PhysiCell).
RESULTS: PhysiBoSS provides a flexible and computationally efficient framework to explore the effect of environmental and genetic alterations of individual cells at the population level, bridging the critical gap from single-cell genotype to single-cell phenotype and emergent multicellular behaviour. PhysiBoSS thus becomes very useful when studying heterogeneous population response to treatment, mutation effects, different modes of invasion or isomorphic morphogenesis events. To concretely illustrate a potential use of PhysiBoSS, we studied heterogeneous cell fate decisions in response to TNF treatment. We explored the effect of different treatments and the behaviour of several resistant mutants. We highlighted the importance of spatial information on the population dynamics by considering the effect of competition for resources like oxygen.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: PhysiBoSS is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/sysbio-curie/PhysiBoSS), with a Docker image (https://hub.docker.com/r/gletort/physiboss/). It is distributed as open source under the BSD 3-clause license.

	abstract = {In systems biology, mathematical models and simulations play a crucial role in understanding complex biological systems. Different modelling frameworks are employed depending on the nature and scales of the system under study. For instance, signalling and regulatory networks can be simulated using Boolean modelling, whereas multicellular systems can be studied using agent-based modelling. Herein, we present PhysiBoSS 2.0, a hybrid agent-based modelling framework that allows simulating signalling and regulatory networks within individual cell agents. PhysiBoSS 2.0 is a redesign and reimplementation of PhysiBoSS 1.0 and was conceived as an add-on that expands the PhysiCell functionalities by enabling the simulation of intracellular cell signalling using MaBoSS while keeping a decoupled, maintainable and model-agnostic design. PhysiBoSS 2.0 also expands the set of functionalities offered to the users, including custom models and cell specifications, mechanistic submodels of substrate internalisation and detailed control over simulation parameters. Together with PhysiBoSS 2.0, we introduce PCTK, a Python package developed for handling and processing simulation outputs, and generating summary plots and 3D renders. PhysiBoSS 2.0 allows studying the interplay between the microenvironment, the signalling pathways that control cellular processes and population dynamics, suitable for modelling cancer. We show different approaches for integrating Boolean networks into multi-scale simulations using strategies to study the drug effects and synergies in models of cancer cell lines and validate them using experimental data. PhysiBoSS 2.0 is open-source and publicly available on GitHub with several repositories of accompanying interoperable tools.},

MaBoSS is a software that allows to simulate populations of cells and to model stochastically the intracellular mechanisms that are deregulated in diseases. MaBoSS provides an output of a Boolean model in the form of time-dependent probabilities, for all biological entities (genes, proteins, phenotypes, etc.) of the model.We present a new version of MaBoSS (2.0), including an updated version of the core software and an environment. With this environment, the needs for modeling signaling pathways are facilitated, including model construction, visualization, simulations of mutations, drug treatments and sensitivity analyses. It offers a framework for automated production of theoretical predictions.MaBoSS software can be found at https://maboss.curie.fr, including tutorials on existing models and examples of models.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Boolean and multi-valued logical formalisms are increasingly used to model complex cellular networks. To ease the development and analysis of logical models, a series of software tools have been proposed, often with specific assets. However, combining these tools typically implies a series of cumbersome software installation and model conversion steps. In this respect, the CoLoMoTo Interactive Notebook provides a joint distribution of several logical modeling software tools, along with an interactive web Python interface easing the chaining of complementary analyses. Our computational workflow combines (1) the importation of a GINsim model and its display, (2) its format conversion using the Java library BioLQM, (3) the formal prediction of mutations using the OCaml software Pint, (4) the model checking using the C++ software NuSMV, (5) quantitative stochastic simulations using the C++ software MaBoSS, and (6) the visualization of results using the Python library matplotlib. To illustrate our approach, we use a recent Boolean model of the signaling network controlling tumor cell invasion and migration. Our model analysis culminates with the prediction of sets of mutations presumably involved in a metastatic phenotype.},

	abstract = {Analysing models of biological networks typically relies on workflows in which different software tools with sensitive parameters are chained together, many times with additional manual steps. The accessibility and reproducibility of such workflows is challenging, as publications often overlook analysis details, and because some of these tools may be difficult to install, and/or have a steep learning curve. The CoLoMoTo Interactive Notebook provides a unified environment to edit, execute, share, and reproduce analyses of qualitative models of biological networks. This framework combines the power of different technologies to ensure repeatability and to reduce users' learning curve of these technologies. The framework is distributed as a Docker image with the tools ready to be run without any installation step besides Docker, and is available on Linux, macOS, and Microsoft Windows. The embedded computational workflows are edited with a Jupyter web interface, enabling the inclusion of textual annotations, along with the explicit code to execute, as well as the visualization of the results. The resulting notebook files can then be shared and re-executed in the same environment. To date, the CoLoMoTo Interactive Notebook provides access to the software tools GINsim, BioLQM, Pint, MaBoSS, and Cell Collective, for the modeling and analysis of Boolean and multi-valued networks. More tools will be included in the future. We developed a Python interface for each of these tools to offer a seamless integration in the Jupyter web interface and ease the chaining of complementary analyses.},
